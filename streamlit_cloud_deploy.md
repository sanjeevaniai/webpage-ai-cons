# Deploy Streamlit Dashboard to Streamlit Cloud

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub (Already Done âœ…)
Your code is already on GitHub at: https://github.com/sanjeevaniai/webpage-ai-cons.git

### 2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New app"
4. Select your repository: `sanjeevaniai/webpage-ai-cons`
5. Set the main file path: `streamlit_app.py`
6. Click "Deploy!"

### 3. Update Website Links
Once deployed, you'll get a URL like: `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`

Then update the links in your React app to point to this URL instead of localhost.

## Alternative: Update Links to Point to Streamlit Cloud

Once you have the Streamlit Cloud URL, I can help you update the website links.
